# Publish your website at github.com

## Setting up

1. Create a new repository on your github account.

2. Clone it to your workstation in a new directory using GitHub Desktop.

3. Open the new directory with your editor, e.g. VSC

4. Create /docs subdirectory and save here your files of your website.

5. Create an index.md file, explain the main issue of this site and save it to /docs.

6. Create more .md files and link to them in this way:

        [Create Jekyll website](https://hansratzinger.github.io/make_jekyll/jekyll_create_website.html)

7. The .md files are beeing converted to .html files in the publishing process of GitHub-Pages. Therefore links have to end with an **.html** extension.

8. Commit the repository and push it to GitHub.

9. Go to your GitHub account, click *Settings* and have a look when the site has been deployed. You can manually start to deploy the page by clicking on *deployed* and on the next page on the *Re-run all jobs* button.
